# 🐚 42sh — Unix Shell

## 📘 Description

**42sh** is the direct continuation of the **Minishell 1** and **Minishell 2** projects.  
This shell offers a complete command-line interface, inspired by `tcsh`, with an extended set of features:

- Built-in commands (`cd`, `echo`, `env`, etc.)
- Advanced redirections and operators (`|`, `&&`, `||`, `;`, `>`, `<`, `>>`, backticks)
- Command history management with arrow navigation
- Keyboard interaction support (`Ctrl` shortcuts)
- System binary detection (`which`, `where`)
- Advanced environment variable management

Developed as part of the **B-PSU-200** module at **Epitech**, this project is coded in C.
